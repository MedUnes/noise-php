## ‚ÑπÔ∏è FAQ

#### So what is this?
This is PHP Noise !

An empty skeleton, a list of ready to customize setups.

These setups are commonly used when publishing PHP opensource projects or libraries.

I use this skeleton as a basis when I start a new project on Github.

Instead of spending time setting up configs from scratch, I'd rather customize them.


#### More details?
Nowadays, you don't just write some "working" code and ship it to the community.

There are a couple of disciplines you should follow in order to have your library acceptable by the community (or by yourself :) )

For example, code quality, tests, README, Documentation, License, logo, CHANGELOG, CI and many others.

I call these requirement: **noise**, not in a  pejorative way, but maybe because writing new code is more fun than spending time fixing, testing, validating or documenting it.
